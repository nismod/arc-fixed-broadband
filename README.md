# Fixed Broadband Analysis for Arc scenarios

Estimate fixed broadband network rollout costs. Take [Urban Development
Model](https://github.com/geospatialncl/urban_development_model) outputs for high-resolution
population/built environment scenarios, based on zonal (Local Authority District) scenarios
from [`nismod/arc-scenarios`](https://github.com/nismod/arc-scenarios), and apply statistical
cost/coverage estimates.
